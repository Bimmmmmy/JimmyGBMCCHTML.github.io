    <h2> Borough of Manhattan Community College </h2>
      <p> Borough of Manhattan Community College also know as BMCC is a public community college in New York City located in <a href= "https://goo.gl/maps/sgFd67zr4nkvze7E7">199 Chambers St, New York, NY 10007</a>, I chose to go to BMCC because it was the safest opition, rather if I wanted to go to college or do something eles. I already had a idea what major I wanted to work on if I went to college because I always been interested in computers, so that lead me to a field of computer programming. </p>
